## References and Context

<!-- Usually, before we decide to write ADR about a certain aspect,
there are pre-existing:
 - reference to specification (perma-link to spec)
 - discussions
 - issues (e.g. Proposals)
 - or even draft PRs.

Make sure to link those here to facilitate writing the ADR and
to give the author all required context (this can be helpful even
if you are the author yourself).
